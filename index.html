       My name is Nii, I am from Ghana. I am a student at The American School of Kinshasa. I am in the 10th grade,
       and in this grade, we start something called a Personal Project

       encyclopedia that will help people learn how to code. I am a beginner in coding, and
       by doing this project, it has helped me get a few basics down. My goal is to help people
       find places to learn how to code and to help them understand the importance of coding in
       this changing world. I hope you find this website helpful and that you learn something new.
       <br>
       My goal is to be a data Analyst and I am working towards that goal by learning how to code.
